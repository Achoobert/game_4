Godot version
https://godotengine.org/download/archive/4.2-stable/
Using the "Standard" NOT the C# version

Close this repo, then use Godot's existing import tool. 

If In Doubt, Restart Godot!!!

Current State of Project: 
See the VN3 Kanban

Clone the project, then create a new branch for yourself: `user/magic`
Since we are NOT in a state where we have a 'working' version, merges will go directly onto the main branch. 
Once there is a buildable version, we will switch to the standard develop/main with x.x.x releases
